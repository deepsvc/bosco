              Had a pretty good experience in getting my Fuji CrossPro Ultegra
              Cyclocross serviced. Stanley was kind enough to get the bike
              serviced replaced parts as necessary. <br /> *All the service
              requirements are available and done with professional tools on a
              work station.
              <br /> *Service is done at a domestic place. So you can stand next
              to bike, see what work is going on and eat heads with your
              questions.
              <br /> *Parts if not available are procured from outside at no
              extra cost.
              <br /> *Call up and fix your time for bike service to avoid
              delays.
              <br /> Rest assured, your bike is in good hands even if there is a
              slight delay.

              Perfect. Lucky to find them. I was referred to them by a pro
              rider.
              <br /> Personal attention. Well trained. Stanly is the man! I
              serviced my cycle before a long tour.
              <br /> And also have taken his help for a few regular maintenance
              on some of my other cycles.
              <br /> I used to service with some of the best bike stores in
              bangalore.
              <br /> They are all very professional but usually need to get on a
              waitlist to find time with them.
              <br /> Also for routine service they can get needlessly expensive.
              <br /> With Stanly, quick work and good value. Highly recommend.
